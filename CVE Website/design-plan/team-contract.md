# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    (1) Have a nice, professional, and polished website.


2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    (1) Attend meetings on time.
    (2) Communicate attendance or any other conflicts on time in the group chat.
    (3) Commit to individual work.
    (4) Forward submission forms.
    (5) Be open to asking and providing help to other team members.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    (1) Group chat
    (2) Zoom meeting
    (3) In-person meeting
    (4) GitHub
    (5) Email

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

 We will communicate with our client through email. Client has provided addition  email for the marketing department of the organization to which we will recieve content from .There will also be meetings with the client through zoom for feeback occasionally.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

Jane - Communicator ( Will send emails to the client or necessary departments to ensure there is one direct line of commmunication to prevent confusion.)

Marta: Timer/ Scheduler (In charge organizing meetings, ensuring any scheduling  conflicts (notified ahead of time )is account for when planning meetings. Organize work as well so that we stay on track.)

Quanay- File Organizer ( Make sure all files within VS Code are organized for easy access)

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    Let team members know from the beginning that you need to be responsible. If they don't commit, we are not going to give them credits.

2. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    Discuss and debate openly in team meetings until we come to a good conclusion.

8.What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    When a conflict appears, we will re-visit the contract.

1. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    We will visit the dairy bar before it gets REALLY cold!


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
