# CVE Website
In this project I created along with another 2 team members a  static, client-side only website for the Cornell Venture and Entrepeneurship Club. 
The design journey reflects the working process of the whole website where we included web design patterns ans visual design principles in order to create a consistent experience for our site's users.
